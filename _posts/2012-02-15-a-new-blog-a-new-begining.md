I've been looking for a way to share my thoughts to others. This is the result - a new blog besides my personal web page. Everything got necessary updates and this is now the main place for my communication with public.

My website history goes back to 2004 when I uploaded my first HTML file to a public server. The site then existed almost continuously on different host and addresses. Now I own my own domain on paid stable hosting, host my three open-source projects, eyeOS web operating system ...

I hope I will manage to post at least once a month, mainly in English for everyone to understand (we Slovenians supposedly speak English very well), so stay tuned for new post soon!
