<p class="lead">Over the next few weeks, I will move VLC-Qt repository to its own organisation. This will allow multiple repositories and easier contributors management. The migration should go through smoothly and will be available under <a href="https://github.com/vlc-qt/" target="_blank">https://github.com/vlc-qt</a>.</p>

<h2>Multiple repositories</h2>
I will use this opportunity to split VLC-Qt into three repositories:

 * Main VLC-Qt repository under <a href="https://github.com/vlc-qt/vlc-qt" target="_blank">/vlc-qt</a>
 * VLC-Qt Extras repository for non-LGPL licensed and 3rd-party code under <a href="https://github.com/vlc-qt/vlc-qt" target="_blank">/vlc-qt-extras</a>
 * Examples repository <a href="https://github.com/vlc-qt/examples" target="_blank">/examples</a>

Especially the last repository will enable more and better examples, which will ease the use of the library for newcomers.
