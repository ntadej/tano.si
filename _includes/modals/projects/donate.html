                        You can also support the development by donating some money. This money will be spent to cover all expenses and hosting costs.</p>
                    <p>And how does this benefit you?
                        Your donation may speed up the development of the projects and give additional motivation to the developers.
                        Every donor will also get a chance of early previews of new versions and features.</p>
